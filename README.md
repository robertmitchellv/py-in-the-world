# Py-in-the-World 

Clone of the simple Minecraft-inspired demo written in Python and Pyglet by fogleman.  Name comes from the
Heideggerian term _In-der-Welt-sein_, or, 'Being-in-the-world', which seems to work nicely with a game
that can only simulate being in a world where you can only build or destruct!  I hope to change textures, 
and build my only minecraft/sim city/lego throwback while learning a ton along the way.
